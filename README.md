### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:

    - Problem Solving
    - Team Work
    - Written and Verbal Communication
    - Leadership
    - Currently I'm working on my coding skills specifically in front end dev.
    - My goal this year is to focus on honing my front end dev skills in Java Script , SQL and frame works  
    - I need to improve more on reading , as this is a universal skill of learning . in order to achieve this i have to read more books , not just to read but also to comprehend info and relate it to real life 
      experiences
      
3. **Interests and Values**:
    
   
    - My key interest in Software Dev is the ability for one to be more creative and yet solve real life problems . Being in a learning enviroment constantly and thus allowing continuous growth and development 
      professionally and personally.
      
    -In a working Enviroment - I cherish values such as helping others out and being creative and original . This is also a learning curve in its own deminer, and helping others out creates a more friendly 
     enviroment to work in, wich in turn allows for growth and easy collaboration with others.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Roles i have interest and researched are namely: Front end Developer, Back end developer and all the requirements that one needs to obtain a job in both fields (full stack )
      
    - Through my research , i have realised that i have a bit of both worlds , front end which mostly consists of creativity and design and back end which is more of the technical side and deals with the 
      technical stuff rather . From doing a deep personality search my ultimate goal would be to delve into full stack developer as this would contain both areas of INTJ and ESFP OF THE 16personalities 
      personality test.
      
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - These industry roles are well aligned with how my personality score reflects , such as being creative , being curious and wanting to know how cetain things are made and how they can be implemented  for the 
      better. Ultimately how these roles can also help for the greater of good,  which is something that is also aligned with my values of helping out in any way possible.

      - Areas of improvement/include blending these skills with more soft skills. such as communication (verbal/written) leadership skills. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

     1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

1.2 JavaScript - I should attain my Javascript certificate with in a year at code space 
-This Bootcamp is further more devided into smaller measurable time bound goals that are all devided into the year of my learning.
-Monthly - I Should be able to reflect on each module for the month and have built something that i have learned. 
-Daily - My goal is to be accountable daily towards working on achieving daily targets , thus being directly proportional to my monthly target and eventually year goal of Front end dev. my daily goal would be to learn something new every day with regards to coding.

1.3 The rationale behind each goal is to bring me one step closer towards my year goal of attaining my Front end Dev Certificate , and also that would bring me closer to my 5 year goal of being a full stack developer

     1. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - My long term carreer aspirations would be growth within the vast Tech industry . From research I did , my 5 year goal would entail me successfully becoming a full stack developer.
    - These align with my interest and skills in such a way that I'm able to be more creative when learning and applying what ive learned this in turn allows me to broaden my skills while doing something that i 
      enjoy doing and then in turn willing to put in more time in really delving deeper in both front and back end dev.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - To achieve my short term goals i need to be accountable for my actions daily , and work towards completing each task set out and also track my progress towards achieving set-out goals. This is achievable 
      also by setting priorities straight and delagating important stuff first.
      
    - All the support needed to achieve this is : Alumni , Coaches , Code-space learning materials , and having a mentor who woould be able to guide and provide feedback where it is required.
    
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.
    - 
    - The preparations needed would include , having a growth mindset and not a fixed one , having grit and not letting uncertanties get in the way of the long term goals, hard work and using the compound effect 
      which in my case would be to use the Kaizen effect wich is a Japanese methodology that adding 1% daily to improve long term rewsults.
      
    ~ Additionally improving my reading skills daily , can help improve my overall learning experience with coding and obtaining the skills and qualifications needed to do achive my set out goals.  

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Being too hard on myself , and self doubt.
    - 
    - I can overcome these adversities by seeking motivation and mentorship from professional tech gurus who have also been through the same experience and can be able to shed light on how they overcame their 
      challenges. This can be streched further by joining communities in the tech space and seeing the different challenges that students go through and how they overcame them.
      
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - opportunities i can use would be joining tech communities to meet other creative minds in the same space and getting to learn from them could be beneficial and a good trajectoory towards career development 
       this would include networking , socializing attaining mentorship and gaining educational insight while at it.
